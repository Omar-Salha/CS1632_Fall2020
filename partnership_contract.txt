[Partnership Contract]

Please write your name and your partner's name below:

Partner 1: Omar Salha
Partner 2: Nikhil Garlapati

1. I shall do my fair share of work for all group work.  I understand that I
may receive a different score from my partner upon adjudication, if a complaint
is filed by my partner on that matter.  I understand that git repository commit
history is an indication of my contribution to the group.

2. I shall notify my partner on termination of partnership as soon as possible
and no later than 2 days after project release (partnership initiation is
allowed at any time up to the deadline).  I shall also immediately resubmit my
new contract to courseweb on change of partnership status.

3. I shall communicate with my partner on the division of work within 1 week
of project release, or immediately on group formation if I form the group
after 1 week has already passed.

4. I shall respond to my partner's emails within 24 hours, bar an emergency.

Please fill in your name(s), convert to PDF and submit to GradeScope at the
"Partnership Contract" assignment link.  Please do an initial submission
before 8/28 midnight.  If you don't have (or want) a partner, please leave the
Partner 2 entry empty and fill in Partner 1 with your name.  Feel free to
submit (and re-submit) your contract any time during the semester whenever you
have a change in the status of your partnership.  Submitting this document on
GradeScope will bind you to this contract, effective on the date of
submission.
